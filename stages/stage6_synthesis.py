    Task:
    1. Identify a clear and defensible research gap that is NOT fully addressed by the knowledge base.
    2. Propose a specific ORIGINAL contribution (Algorithm, Framework, Model, or Survey Analysis) to fill this gap.
    3. Synthesize ideas across sources to support this contribution.
    4. Outline a methodology.
    5. DESIGN simulated/conceptual results that would validate this contribution (Do NOT fabricate real-world data, but describe what the results *would* show concepts or simulation).
    
    Constraint:
    - Avoid plagiarism entirely.
    - Clearly mark results as simulated/conceptual.
